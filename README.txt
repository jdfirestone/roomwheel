# Weekly Project Progress



## Week 1

This week I spent many hours trying to figure out the best way to create the javascript and basic "bones" of a wheel that randomly selects chores for roommates. I have met my week 1 goals by creating a wheel and a page that can log it's outputs. I was able to achieve this by utilizing a javascript library called winwheel.js and then manipulating the DOM to append my code and log the wheel's output. There is still a little bit of javascript in my HTML tags but this will be optimized by next week so that all scripts are in my js file. Excited to move forward and see more of my work come together!

## Week 2

This week I started by cleaning the code up from last week. I got rid of the javascript within my HTML and migrated everything to my js file. I then followed my project plan by adding the options for the user to select segments for the wheel, along with being able to remove the last segment added. This took a lot of time playing around with winwheel.js and learning to adapt it to my needs. I wouldn't say it's perfect in terms of UX but it works with the within the limitation of the winwheel library. Next week I will tackle design and layout, adding CSS (possibly bootstrap), and making the wheel work well on mobile.

## Week 3

This week I added CSS to make my wheel look good. I had to add colors in the Javascript due to the function of the javascript library I used to create the wheel. I ran into a problem with the media queries where they would work when I dragged my window smaller but not in the dev tools. You will see in my commits that I was able to troubleshoot and solve this issue. What do you think of the colors and layout? I personally like simple layout but am open to any suggestions for the final submission. Besides for that, my wheel works  as described in my project plan and everything added from now on will just be to give the wheel an improved UX/UI.

## Final

This project was my favorite part of this whole course. Since I had the control of what and how I built this app from scratch, it was exciting and rewarding to see my own creation come to life. I found that starting from scratch was a good review of many of the concepts I needed to brush up on that weren’t covered in a while. More importantly, I think building this app gave me the confidence to move on to more complex projects that I’ve always wanted to build. I purposely elected a project goal that I knew would be challenging so that I would have to push myself to be able to complete it. One of the most helpful skills I learned was using a new javascript library and troubleshooting for solutions to different problems using the plethora of web message boards. There are still a bunch of features and improvements I plan on adding, thanks Ryan and Gabrielle for the suggestions!
