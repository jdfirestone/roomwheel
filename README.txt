This week I started by cleaning the code up from last week. I got rid of the javascript within my HTML and migrated everything to my js file. I then followed my project plan by adding the options for the user to select segments for the wheel, along with being able to remove the last segment added. This took a lot of time playing around with winwheel.js and learning to adapt it to my needs. I wouldn't say it's perfect in terms of UX but it works with the within the limitation of the winwheel library. Next week I will tackle design and layout, adding CSS (possibly bootstrap), and making the wheel work well on mobile.
