This week I spent many hours trying to figure out the best way to create the javascript and basic "bones" of a wheel that randomly selects chores for roommates. I have met my week 1 goals by creating a wheel and a page that can log it's outputs. I was able to achieve this by utilizing a javascript library called winwheel.js and then manipulating the DOM to append my code and log the wheel's output. There is still a little bit of javascript in my HTML tags but this will be optimized by next week so that all scripts are in my js file. Excited to move foward and see more of my work come together!
